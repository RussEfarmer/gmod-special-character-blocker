# gmod-special-character-blocker
Addon to block special characters in Garry's Mod game chat (Serverside)

This addon is based on my bad-word-slur-blocker addon, but modified to detect and block chat messages special characters. This includes non-English keyboard layouts and Lenny faces. It was designed to stop players from evading other chat filter addons.

This addon is compatable with other chat filter addons.
